            <p class="text-white-50 ">Stars, the celestial beacons that light up the night sky, have captivated humanity for millennia. These luminous spheres of plasma, held together by their own gravity, are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. From the tiny red dwarfs to the colossal blue giants, stars come in a dazzling array of sizes, temperatures, and ages.

                The birth of a star begins in vast clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. As these clouds collapse under their own gravity, they spin faster and faster, heating up in the process. Eventually, the core of the cloud becomes hot and dense enough for nuclear fusion to ignite, releasing immense amounts of energy in the form of light and heat. This process, known as stellar nucleosynthesis, powers stars throughout their lives.
                
                The life cycle of a star is determined primarily by its mass. Smaller stars, like our Sun, fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores. When the hydrogen supply runs out, the core contracts, while the outer layers expand, forming a red giant. Eventually, the core becomes dense enough to fuse helium into heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen. The star's outer layers are then expelled, leaving behind a dense, hot core called a white dwarf.
