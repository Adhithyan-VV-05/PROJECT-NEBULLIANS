            <p class="text-white-50 ">Asteroids, often referred to as minor planets, are rocky or metallic objects that orbit the Sun. They are significantly smaller than planets and moons, but their potential impact on Earth makes them a subject of great scientific interest and concern. Asteroids are believed to be remnants of the formation of our solar system, and studying them can provide valuable insights into the early history of our cosmic neighborhood.

                Asteroids vary greatly in size, ranging from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in diameter. Some asteroids are irregularly shaped, while others have more spherical forms. They can be composed of various materials, including silicate rocks, iron-nickel alloys, and carbon-rich compounds. Many asteroids are grouped together in specific regions of the solar system, such as the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) that pass close to Earth's orbit.
                
                The impact of an asteroid with Earth can have devastating consequences. In the past, large asteroid impacts have been linked to mass extinctions, such as the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. While the risk of a catastrophic asteroid impact is relatively low, it is not zero. As a result, scientists and space agencies are constantly monitoring and tracking near-Earth asteroids to identify potential threats and develop strategies for mitigation.
