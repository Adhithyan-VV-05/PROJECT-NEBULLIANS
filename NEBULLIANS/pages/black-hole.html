            <p class="text-white-50 ">Black holes, often referred to as cosmic monsters, are among the most mysterious and fascinating objects in the universe. These celestial bodies are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Their existence was first theorized by John Michell in 1783, but it wasn't until the early 20th century that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity provided a solid theoretical foundation for their existence.

                The formation of a black hole is a dramatic event. When a massive star, several times the mass of our Sun, reaches the end of its life, it undergoes a catastrophic collapse. As the star's core shrinks, its gravitational pull intensifies until it becomes so powerful that even light, the fastest thing in the universe, cannot escape. This region of spacetime, where gravity is infinitely strong, is known as a singularity. Surrounding the singularity is the event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing can escape.
