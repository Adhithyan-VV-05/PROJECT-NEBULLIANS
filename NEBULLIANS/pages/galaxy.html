            <p class="txt-con">Galaxies, vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. These cosmic islands are held together by gravity and come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and ages. While the Milky Way is our home galaxy, billions of others exist throughout the observable universe.

                The most common type of galaxy is the spiral galaxy, characterized by a central bulge surrounded by a disk of stars and interstellar material. Spiral arms, filled with young, bright stars and nebulae, extend from the bulge. Examples of spiral galaxies include the Milky Way and Andromeda.
                
                Elliptical galaxies are another major type, shaped like elongated spheres or footballs. They are composed primarily of older stars and have little interstellar gas or dust. Elliptical galaxies can vary greatly in size, from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.
                
                Irregular galaxies lack a definite shape and are often smaller than spiral or elliptical galaxies. They may be the result of collisions or mergers between other galaxies.
                
                Galaxies are not isolated entities but are often found in groups or clusters. The Local Group, for example, is a cluster of galaxies that includes the Milky Way, Andromeda, and several smaller galaxies. Larger structures known as superclusters are composed of multiple galaxy clusters.
